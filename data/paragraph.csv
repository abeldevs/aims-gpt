Research activity commenced at AIMS South Africa in 2003, mostly through a limited number of short-term research fellowships sponsored by the Ford Foundation, the Victor Rothschild Memorial Fund and the National Research Foundation. However, research at AIMS South Africa started off in earnest after the AIMS South Africa Research Centre was launched during May 2008 (following the purchase and refurbishment of two historical double-storey houses opposite the AIMS main building in Melrose Road) and after a grant was secured from the Department of Science and Technology at the end of 2008.
The Research Centre was launched with the mission to conduct and foster outstanding research and learning in the mathematical sciences, thus contributing to the next generation of pan-African leaders in many spheres and the advancement of African science and academia within a multicultural environment.
This is achieved by creating a research environment with focused themes; integrating research with postgraduate training and developing young researchers; and providing a space for mathematical scientists to work together and interact with local and international researchers within their focus framework. 
The research conducted has a strong focus on cutting-edge topics which relate to mathematical modelling in a multi-disciplinary context. In particular those that are most relevant to African development, especially in fields where scientists in Africa have a competitive advantage and can do world-leading research. 
Research is focused on the following areas:
Close involvement with local universities and other research institutions is encouraged, thus widening the pool of available expertise and serving to initiate long-term research programmes in the local academic community. Researchers also collaborate with international experts in their field and with researchers in Africa to ensure strong pan-African participation in the Centre’s programmes, and to stimulate the growth of pan-African research networks and partnerships.
We also maintain close ties with industry by running programmes associated with particular industrial needs, assisting in capacity building and collaboration on innovative projects.

AIMS South Africa has trained a total of 919 students since its inception in 2003. Our students benefit from the experience of renowned visiting lecturers who teach for three weeks in turn. Capacity building is provided by tutors who are always available on campus to ensure a 24-hour learning environment. 
With backgrounds in mathematics, engineering, physics, computer science, as well as actuarial science, our students come from 41 African countries. 
The table below shows the top 10 Alumni nationalities at AIMS South Africa.


“We should not underestimate the value of this feeling that AIMS is an institute in which we are all learning and teaching together with the common goal of sharing our knowledge and experiences with each other.”
The main AIMS South Africa building is a self-contained residential centre with excellent computer, library and lecturing facilities. Lecturers and students live and dine in the main building, allowing for maximum contact time in an informal and collegiate setting. 

AIMS tuition, study materials and housing are fully funded through a generous scholarship. AIMS’ residential nature allows more contact time between lecturers and students than is available in a typical university setting.
Students typically study two subjects for three weeks each, with each day comprising morning lectures followed by problem-solving and computing sessions each afternoon. Additional tutorials and special lectures are held in the evenings when students also usually complete their assignments.
All lectures at AIMS South Africa are presented in English. AIMS regards communication skills as a crucial part of the training both in respect of the spoken language and thewritten language. As English is not the first language of many of the students, English Language classes, taught by the Language and Communications Teacher, at various levels, are available and held regularly, particularly at the beginning of the academic year.
All AIMS students are required to invest at least 20 hours in community service activities during the academic year to strengthen their leadership skills as well as their commitment to give-back to Africa.
AIMS South Africa is located in Muizenberg, a small seaside resort and surfers paradise and an area of outstanding natural beauty. 
AIMS South Africa is ideally situated within 100 metres of the sea. There is a good train connection to Cape Town city centre and to Simonstown, a picturesque naval base and how to a growing African penguin colony. The road through Simonstown will take you to a Nature Reserve at Cape Point. Cape Town is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and much of it can be explored using Muizenberg as a base.
The site is a half hour drive away from the three local Universities, the centre of Cape Town and Cape Town international airport. 
AIMS South Africa is proud to have produced 870 graduates, 35% of whom are women. Our alumni represent 41 countries, and are serving as leaders in academia and industry.

The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa Annual Report 2004-2005
AIMS South Africa offers an intensive one-year postgraduate course leading to a Structured Master’s in Mathematical Sciences, formally accredited by the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, and the Western Cape. The programme is taught in association with the faculty of the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Paris Sud XI.
AI for Science is a new stream in AIMS South Africa’s Master’s degree in Mathematical Science, made possible through a partnership with DeepMind and is being introduced as part of the August 2023 intake. 
The course provides both a broad overview of cutting-edge sciences and strong mathematical and computing research skills. The course is unique, offering students exposure to a range of topics, thereby allowing them to make an informed choice as to their future specialisation. The goal is to develop well-rounded scientists, with excellent problem-solving skills, capable of creative thinking and genuine innovation. There is a strong grounding in end-to-end skills, from problem formulation, estimation, prioritization, and generally applicable mathematical and computing methods, through to clear and concise scientific report writing. A number of modules which also make the course interesting and relevant to prospective mathematics and science teachers have been included.
Faculties from the nearby Universities of the Western Cape, Cape Town and Stellenbosch have been intimately involved in developing the AIMS course. World-leading scientists and educators have volunteered to teach at AIMS. Their participation ensures an education of the highest international quality. Tutors (often including alumni) provide teaching and administrative assistance, assistance to foreign language speakers, and continuity across the visiting lecturers.
Students are registered at one of the three local universities: Cape Town, Stellenbosch or Western Cape.
Completing a course of such scope and depth in just one academic year is possible only if it is highly intensive, so students must come prepared to work hard and focus. The residential nature of AIMS allows far greater contact time between lecturers and students than normally available in a university setting. Courses are student-centered but very demanding. Students study two subjects at a time every three weeks, with morning lectures and related afternoon problem solving and computing sessions. Each course consists of 30 hours contact time (10 per week). Additional tutorials and special lectures are often held in the evenings, when students complete their assignments.
No special preparation for the course is needed on a student’s part. However, the working language is English and foreign students are advised to take an English language course before arrival. The course also carries a large component of scientific computing, and many hours are spent in the computer lab; students who have improved their touch typing skills before the programme will have a distinct advantage.
At AIMS South Africa there are two intakes each year (January and August). The curriculum runs over 3 semesters described below. There is an oral defense of the research project at the end of the academic year followed by a graduation ceremony.
These are designed to provide introductory and foundational material to the students, and are structured to achieve pre-defined outcomes, with little flexibility in their content. All courses are compulsory.
These are fundamentally different in that they include a wide range of topical issues and are more flexibly designed. Students are required to complete 2 out of the 3 available review courses in each time slot, a total of 12. The 3 choices in each time slot will be balanced with respect to focus on mathematics, physics and interdisciplinary topics such as computer science, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and more. The ongoing communication skills and computing classes are compulsory:

During the three-month long Research project students work on a research topic with a supervisor, usually from a South African university. Students are not expected to do original work to achieve a passing grade. However, the criterion for an outstanding research project is broadly that it could constitute the early part of a Research Master’s thesis. For example, it could be publishable in a journal, or form an outstanding introduction to the field that could be used by other students entering the area.During this phase targeted communication skills and computing classes may continue, at the lecturers’ discretion. The purpose of the research project is:

The AIMS mission is to provide an excellent, advanced education to talented and highly motivated African students in order to develop independent thinkers, researchers and problem solvers who will contribute to Africa’s development. One of the key features of studying at AIMS is the highly enriching experience of students and lecturers eating and living together within a 24 hour learning environment, and the consequent friendly and informal atmosphere, coupled with active and meaningful participation during the teaching sessions.
Each year AIMS South Africa takes approximately 70 students from around twenty five different African countries with a complete mix of race, religion and gender. There are two intakes a year, one in January and the other in mid-August. By far the most common response to the question ”What does your year at AIMS really mean to you?” is ”the opportunity to meet, and live with, people from all over the African continent, and to meet, and get to know, the lecturers as individuals”. We should not underestimate the value of this feeling that AIMS is an institute in which we are all learning and teaching together with the common goal of sharing our knowledge and experienceswith each other.
The teaching at AIMS is based on the principle of learning and understanding, rather than simply listening and writing,during classes; and on creating an atmosphere of increasing knowledge through small group discussions. This is achieved by formulating conjectures and assessing the evidence for them, and sometimes going down wrong paths and learning from these mistakes. The essential feature of the classes at AIMS is that, in contrast to formal lecture courses, they are highly interactive; and time is allocated for class discussions. In this way, AIMS provides a climate of interactive teaching, where students are encouraged to learn together in a journey of questioning and discovery, and where lecturers respond to the needs of the class rather than to a pre-determined syllabus. The AIMS teaching philosophy is to promote critical and creative thinking; to experience the excitement of learning from true understanding; and to avoid rote learning directed only towards assessment. Students are helped and encouraged to develop their own ideas, both during and outside formal class times, and to absorb new ideas instead of being presented with the finished product. The teaching at AIMS is done through self-contained (modular) courses in which the advertised content is used as a guide, and lecturers are encouraged, and expected, to adapt daily to meet the needs of the students. The challenge for the lecturers is to create a sense of enquiry in all students who come from very diverse backgrounds. Each student should develop, and succeed, from their own particular starting point. AIMS considers the journey undertaken to reach a conclusion to be as important as the conclusion itself.
All lectures at AIMS South Africa are presented in English. AIMS regards communication skills as a crucial part of the training both in respect of the spoken language and the written language. As English is not the first language of many of the students, English Language classes, taught by the Language and Communications Teacher, at various levels, are available and held regularly, particularly at the beginning of the academic year. Each student is required to give at least one 15-minute presentation, on a mathematical topic related to one of the courses, to the whole class with the help and advice of one of the lecturers. Sessions on scientific writing are also held – particularly near the research-project phase.

The AIMS Associate Faculty recognises lecturers who have made significant contributions at AIMS, not only through lecturing a course more than once, but also through additional engagement in AIMS’ activities. Members are appointed for four years and can be reappointed.


The AIMS Master’s in Mathematical Sciences includes a research project, which makes up one third of the course.
The purpose of an AIMS research project is:
The project contains a survey of literature and methods at the forefront of some topic appropriate for a student beginning research in the Mathematical Sciences. It typically contains examples, perhaps by computation/simulation, and some independent work. Ideally the topic will prepare the student for a research MSc or a PhD, or to follow a career in commerce, industry or the government sector. 
The project phase lasts three months. In the initial stages of the project students will still be taking courses. This is the time during which students are expected to complete background reading for their project. When courses finish they have six weeks to dedicate to the project; this is the time when interaction with the supervisor is most frequent (weekly is the norm), and when the work and writing up is done. Each student is assigned a tutor for support; however the tutor is not a co-supervisor.
There are two student intakes, August intake and January intake. Proposal submissions and project start/end differ depending on the intake. The following table shows the typical schedule for a given academic year:
Supervisors can be fully remote or based in South-Africa. Both are encouraged. Remote supervisors give the students the opportunity to connect with the international scientific community. 
Supervisors should be well versed in the field within which the project is proposed. They are expected to guide students in their research projects and to help clarify difficult concepts.
The supervisor is expected to be available during the three months of the research project. Weekly interactions are the norm. The supervisor shall guide the student and respond in a timely manner to queries and to comment on drafts.
The final evaluation is a 15 to 20 minutes and thereafter responds to questions and discussion provided by the supervisor and other examiners. The supervisor is also expected to be present for the examination, either on Zoom/Skype for remote supervisors or locally. 

Teaching assistants are a fundamental feature of the AIMS model. AIMS South Africa appoints between eight and ten advanced postgraduate students as teaching assistants. Briefly, the duties of the teaching assistants are to provide assistance to the Academic Director and lecturers in matters concerning the academic programme and the assessment of students. Teaching assistants attend the lecture courses; arrange additional tutorials; assist with the marking of assignments; and assist the students with computing and research project writing. Teaching assistants also provide useful information to assist the Academic Director (and sometimes lecturers, who are under no obligation to provide references for students) when writing student references. Teaching assistants are recruited via an announcement through AIMS’ mailing lists.Criteria considered for selection include: academic achievement, ability to speak relevant languages, and an ability to function in the unusual AIMS teaching environment.
Appointments will normally be made for a minimum duration of one full academic year, which runs from mid-August until the end of June.
Duties
Providing general assistance to the director and the lecturers within the academic program, for example in assisting with problem-solving classes and computer labs, in providing group and personal tutorials where needed, in contributing to the assessment of student performance on a continuous basis, in preparing additional materials, examples and extra classes as needed.
Requirements
At least a Master’s in one of the mathematical sciences; superior teaching ability/skills; excellent interpersonal skills; innovative flair; excellent command of English and/or French; ability to work as a dedicated member of a team where responsibility is shared. Knowledge of an additional language, in particular Arabic, would be an advantage.
Computer skills
Linux, SAGE or SciPy.

The Industry Immersion Program was launched in 2017, in partnership with the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), Berlin, and with funding support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ) through the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
The program transfers competencies from one of Europe’s leading business schools and develops business links between African graduates and German businesses operating in Africa through internship and post-graduate employment.
Towards the end of 2020, the organization partnered with Academics Without Borders (AWB) in Canada, whose mission is to help developing countries improve their universities so that they can train their own experts (train the trainer) and conduct research to assist in their countries development. So far, AWB has proven to be a very reliable partner in her scaling prospects. Through their efforts, we partnered with Strathmore University to run the IIP in 2021 and 2022.
In 2022, we ran the program in 6 African countries, transferring competencies to 100 cohorts of Students. This is a landmark achievement in IIP’s scaling effort.   
Highlights of the program include the opportunity for qualified and industry-oriented AIMS graduating students and AIMS alumni to participate in a fully-funded 20-week residential Industry Immersion Program that offers the opportunity to contribute to the economic transformation of Africa through a practical, skills-based employability program.
Participants will gain the necessary managerial and organizational skills and behavioral competencies suitable for employment. The program offers a mixture of academic and practical learning and skills development which will allow participants to transition from a scientific environment to an applied industry setting.
The backbone of the program is a 12-week internship module with participating industry partners, beginning five weeks after the program starts, during which participants will experience a business environment firsthand and apply their academic learning. Companies will also undertake a team-based consulting project with a group of interns.
Please click here for more information.
The 2023 program will start at the beginning of July at AIMS South Africa. Applications from AIMS Alumni and students with an interest in business are welcome.

Understanding Fluid Flow takes a fresh approach to introducing fluid dynamics, with physical reasoning and mathematical developments inextricably intertwined. The ‘dry’ fluid dynamics described by potential theory is set within the context of real viscous flows to give fundamental insight into how fluids behave.  The book gives a flavour of theoretical, experimental and numerical approaches to analysing fluid flow, and implicitly develops skills in applied mathematical modelling of physical systems. It is supplemented by movies that are freely downloadable.

Mathematical Modelling in One Dimension demonstrates the universality of mathematical techniques through a wide variety of application. Learn how the same mathematical idea governs loan repayments, drug accumulation in tissues or growth of a population, or how the same argument can be used to find the trajectory of a dog pursuing a hare, the trajectory of a self-guided missile of the shape of a satellite dish. The author places equal importance on difference and differential equations, showing how they complement and intertwine in describing natural phenomena.

Mathematical Explorations follows on from the author’s previous book, Creative Mathematics, in the same series, and gives the reader experience in working on problems requiring a little more mathematical maturity. The author’s main aim is to show that problems are often solved by using mathematics that is not obviously connected to the problem, and readers are encouraged to consider as wide a variety of mathematical ideas as possible. In each case, the emphasis is placed on the important underlying ideas rather than on the solutions for their own sake. To enhance understanding of how mathematical research is conducted, each problem has been chosen not for its mathematical importance, but because it provides a good illustration of how arguments can be developed. While the reader does not require a deep mathematical background to tackle these problems, they will find their mathematical understanding is enriched by attempting to solve them.

Research activity commenced at AIMS South Africa in 2003, mostly through a limited number of short-term research fellowships sponsored by the Ford Foundation, the Victor Rothschild Memorial Fund and the National Research Foundation. However, research at AIMS South Africa started off in earnest after the AIMS South Africa Research Centre was launched during May 2008 (following the purchase and refurbishment of two historical double-storey houses opposite the AIMS main building in Melrose Road) and after a grant was secured from the Department of Science and Technology at the end of 2008.
The Research Centre was launched with the mission to conduct and foster outstanding research and learning in the mathematical sciences, thus contributing to the next generation of pan-African leaders in many spheres and the advancement of African science and academia within a multicultural environment.
This is achieved by creating a research environment with focused themes; integrating research with postgraduate training and developing young researchers; and providing a space for mathematical scientists to work together and interact with local and international researchers within their focus framework. 
The research conducted has a strong focus on cutting-edge topics which relate to mathematical modelling in a multi-disciplinary context. In particular those that are most relevant to African development, especially in fields where scientists in Africa have a competitive advantage and can do world-leading research. 
Research is focused on the following areas:
Close involvement with local universities and other research institutions is encouraged, thus widening the pool of available expertise and serving to initiate long-term research programmes in the local academic community. Researchers also collaborate with international experts in their field and with researchers in Africa to ensure strong pan-African participation in the Centre’s programmes, and to stimulate the growth of pan-African research networks and partnerships.
We also maintain close ties with industry by running programmes associated with particular industrial needs, assisting in capacity building and collaboration on innovative projects.

Harness the potential of young scientists impassioned about discovery and inspired by the promise of a new future for Africa.
AIMS South Africa selects the best students from a large pool of applications each year. The goal of this unique course is to develop well-rounded African scientists, with excellent problem-solving skills, capable of creative thinking and genuine innovation.
One of the most crucial aspects of the AIMS model is our ability to provide scholarships to students across Africa. All AIMS students receive bursaries which cover travel, accommodation, meals, medical insurance, tuition, university registration fees and a modest monthly stipend. Without this scholarship many deserving students would not be able to take up this life-changing opportunity.
For as little as $20 a month you could cover a student’s stipend each month or a once off gift of $100 would cover medical aid for one student for the year.

The BSc (Honours) in Mathematics with a focus in Biomathematics is an annual course run in conjunction with Stellenbosch University. The course commences in January each year. It aims to meet the growing demand from molecular biology, systems biology, bioinformatics, ecology, and biomedical science for students and researchers with solid mathematical skills. The course aims to train mathematicians to formulate and analyse precise models for experimental data arising from real-life research problems within the fields of biology and medicine — from predicting the influence of HIV, Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis to the effects of climate change on South Africa.
The course requires a strong foundation in mathematics and an introduction to mathematical modelling using differential equations, and includes modules on: computational and discrete methods in Mathematical Biology, non-linear dynamical systems in mathematical biology, advanced topics in mathematical biology, topics in biological and biomedical sciences, as well as a project. Projcet topics include the application of mathematical, computational and/or statistical methods to analyse and solve problems in biological sciences, environmental sciences, and medical sciences.
The modules will be presented by local and international researchers in modelling of biological and biomedical systems, population dynamics, mathematical biology, bio-informatics. The projects will be supervised by a researcher in mathematical sciences and a researcher in biological or biomedical sciences.
Students spend the first half of the year at AIMS and the second half of the year at Stellenbosch University.
Overview of 2017 Biomaths courses (towards Honours) offered at AIMS
The Honours in Mathematical Biology course is jointly run by the Stelllenbosch University’s Department of Mathematical Sciences and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).  The application procedure and form is available via Stellenbosch University’s Science Faculty webpage  under Information for Students, Postgraduate Programmes, and the Department of Mathematical Sciences website, under Honours courses. 
South African students with a good BSc majoring in Mathematics, and (at least) some courses in a biological/biomedical field, or an equivalent qualification, can apply. 
For more information please send an email to biomath-info@aims.ac.za.

This page allows you to submit a proposal for one or more courses which you would like to teach at any AIMS centre. There will be slight flexibility at each centre and some differences between centres’ exact programmes. Programmes are finalised in discussion with the director and/or curriculum committee at each centre.
Please read the following information carefully before proceeding to the application page
The AIMS Structured Master’s in Mathematical Sciences Programme commences in September each year at all centres. AIMS South Africa offers a second intake commencing in January for South African students. Prospective lecturers are advised to submit proposals by 28 February for courses in the programme starting the following September (or January). Selection of courses will take place during March and April and all proposers will have been advised of the outcome in early June.
As there are many more course proposals than available course slots, the submission of a course proposal does not guarantee automatic acceptance into the curriculum. The AIMS governing bodies reserve the right to actively recruit additional lecturers and schedule additional courses on an ad-hoc basis, in order to ensure a well-balanced course of the highest possible quality.
After an introductory week, the curriculum for the AIMS Master’s in Mathematical Sciences is divided into three categories: skills courses and review courses followed by a research project (where no formal courses are taught). These run in parallel with some continuous communication and computing classes presented by AIMS staff during all phases. Proposals are solicited for the skills and review courses. Each course will consist of 30 hours contact time (10 per week), that is approximately 15 to 18 hours lecturing with additional time (12 to 15 hours) for discussion and practical/tutorial work.
Skills courses are designed to provide introductory and foundational material to the students, and are structured to achieve pre-defined outcomes, with little flexibility in their content. The time slots during which the skills courses will be taught are provisional as in the typical skills course programme at AIMS South Africa shown below. The order of these courses often varies. Exact dates could differ at the different AIMS centres.
Review courses are fundamentally different in that they are designed to offer opportunities to teach on a wide range of topical issues. Lecturers thus have flexibility in designing their courses, subject to the guidelines set out below. Review courses will be taught from December through March in the time slots outlined below. The 3 courses in each time unit are usually balanced with respect to focus on mathematics, physics and interdisciplinary topics.
You will be given the opportunity to choose one or more time slots within which you would be prepared to teach your review course. The more time slots you are available for, the greater the chance of being selected.
During the review phase each student gives a presentation of 10 or 15 mins, with 5 mins of questions/discussion. Although the vehicle for the presentation is a topic related to the course, emphasis is on style (addressing the audience, clear slides, good selection of material, and fielding of questions, etc.). Together with briefer presentationsgiven in the skills course IT & LaTeX, this helps to prepare students for the oral defense at the end of the year.
Students book a presentation in a course with the lecturer, usually on the first day of the course (first come, first served). Sometimes they have an idea of what they want to talk about, in which case the lecturer need only make a note of the student name and topic (to give to the head tutor). But sometimes they have no idea of topic, only that they like the course area. In that case the leturer suggests a topic, with references. It may be to summarise a further topic in the course, or related material; or to present a proof omitted in the course. The topic is less important than the delivery.
On average each course attracts three presentations, which are usually scheduled in the last hour of the course (since that is least intrusive). In the middle week of the course the lecturer checks that the student is progressing with preparation for the presentation, and may listen to a practice.
During the Research project phase students work on a research topic with a supervisor.
AIMS encourages, but does not require, cooperation between local and international lecturers. The form therefore permits you to enter the email address of a co-lecturer. AIMS provides several teaching assistants throughout the year, but in some (rare) cases, lecturers may wish to bring an advanced masters or PhD student of theirs along to assist, e.g. with a particularly challenging practical or computational component of the course.

The AIMS curriculum is extremely ambitious in attempting to provide students from very diverse backgrounds with excellent mathematics and computing research skills plus a broad overview of cutting-edge sciences, all within a very limited period.
Such an outcome is achievable only if full advantage is taken of the self-contained, residential nature of the AIMS institute which allows for greater contact time and interaction between students and lecturers than would normally be possible within a conventional university setting.
The intensive lectures-plus-tutorial-per-day format that is envisaged for AIMS courses implies that courses will have to cover fewer topics (as compared to normal graduate equivalents), and instead concentrate on covering fundamental results and techniques thoroughly in a participatory tutorial and problem-solving style.
Due to the diversity of students and topics, courses need to be highly student-centered i.e. unusually sensitive and responsive to the needs of the students. All courses should

For an indication of the scope and level of courses usually offered, view the previous year’s course pages of AIMS South Africa.
Teaching assistants are a fundamental feature of the AIMS model. AIMS South Africa appoints between eight and ten advanced postgraduate students as teaching assistants. Briefly, the duties of the teaching assistants are to provide assistance to the Academic Director and lecturers in matters concerning the academic programme and the assessment of students. Teaching assistants attend the lecture courses; arrange additional tutorials; assist with the marking of assignments; and assist the students with computing and research project writing. Teaching assistants also provide useful information to assist the Academic Director (and sometimes lecturers, who are under no obligation to provide references for students) when writing student references. Teaching assistants are recruited via an announcement through AIMS’ mailing lists.Criteria considered for selection include: academic achievement, ability to speak relevant languages, and an ability to function in the unusual AIMS teaching environment.
Appointments will normally be made for a minimum duration of one full academic year, which runs from mid-August until the end of June.
Duties
Providing general assistance to the director and the lecturers within the academic program, for example in assisting with problem-solving classes and computer labs, in providing group and personal tutorials where needed, in contributing to the assessment of student performance on a continuous basis, in preparing additional materials, examples and extra classes as needed.
Requirements
At least a Master’s in one of the mathematical sciences; superior teaching ability/skills; excellent interpersonal skills; innovative flair; excellent command of English and/or French; ability to work as a dedicated member of a team where responsibility is shared. Knowledge of an additional language, in particular Arabic, would be an advantage.
Computer skills
Linux, SAGE or SciPy.
Applications
Applications close when all positions are filled. Applicants should include a motivation letter (indicating which centre(s) they prefer), a CV and a list of two contactable references. Please click the button in the image below to submit an application.
If you have any queries about tutoring at AIMS South Africa please email tutoring@aims.ac.za

The AIMS Master’s in Mathematical Sciences includes a research project, which makes up one third of the course.
The purpose of an AIMS research project is:
The project contains a survey of literature and methods at the forefront of some topic appropriate for a student beginning research in the Mathematical Sciences. It typically contains examples, perhaps by computation/simulation, and some independent work. Ideally the topic will prepare the student for a research MSc or a PhD, or to follow a career in commerce, industry or the government sector. 
The project phase lasts three months. In the initial stages of the project students will still be taking courses. This is the time during which students are expected to complete background reading for their project. When courses finish they have six weeks to dedicate to the project; this is the time when interaction with the supervisor is most frequent (weekly is the norm), and when the work and writing up is done. Each student is assigned a tutor for support; however the tutor is not a co-supervisor.
There are two student intakes, August intake and January intake. Proposal submissions and project start/end differ depending on the intake. The following table shows the typical schedule for a given academic year:
Supervisors can be fully remote or based in South-Africa. Both are encouraged. Remote supervisors give the students the opportunity to connect with the international scientific community. 
Supervisors should be well versed in the field within which the project is proposed. They are expected to guide students in their research projects and to help clarify difficult concepts.
The supervisor is expected to be available during the three months of the research project. Weekly interactions are the norm. The supervisor shall guide the student and respond in a timely manner to queries and to comment on drafts.
The final evaluation is a 15 to 20 minutes and thereafter responds to questions and discussion provided by the supervisor and other examiners. The supervisor is also expected to be present for the examination, either on Zoom/Skype for remote supervisors or locally. 

The AIMS South Africa Research Centre offers Doctoral and Masters bursaries for research study in the Centre (details on the research areas supported at the Research Centre may be found at Research). South African students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds are especially welcome.

Blurring Global North/South Boundaries in Advancement of Equity and Inclusion through Science Communication Practices and Research
The Inclusive SciComm Symposium (ISCS) conference is an ever-evolving and expansive conference that advocates for science communication that prioritizes equity, inclusion, and intersectionality. It (ISCS) aims to build a community that actively challenges the dominant, marginalizing norms of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). 
The 2023 ISCS, hosted in hybrid format by the University of Rhode Island’s Metcalf Institute in Kingston, USA, included a virtual session on “Blurring global North/South boundaries in science communication: mainstreaming epistemic diversity, decolonization, and multilingualism”. The session took place on 13th October and was organised by Rejoyce Gavhi-Molefe, AIMS House of Science Manager, and three other early-career scientists from a variety of Global South backgrounds and/or countries, namely Siddharth Kankaria (India), Sofía Gutiérrez (Mexico), Odon Akanimo (based in the UK; originally from Nigeria) and John Noel Viana (based in Australia; originally from the Philippines). The session was supported by the African Gong – Pan-African Network for the Popularization of Science & Technology and Science Communication in Africa, the Center for Diverse Leadership in Science at UCLA – University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute.  
The virtual session, which was co-moderated by Rejoyce and Siddharth, collated learnings and insights from the four speakers’ recent contributions to a Bristol University Press book on Race & Sociocultural Inclusion in Science Communication and their diverse, intersectional lived experiences.  Rejoyce’s contribution to the session focused on the challenges and opportunities concerning advancing scientific research and its communication/dissemination to the broader public in South Africa and on the continent. It provided some insights on how the capacity-building programme, “Africa Scientifique: Leadership, Knowledge & Skills for Science Communication”, delivered annually to the cohort of AIMS South Africa Master’s students since 2020, is addressing the gaps and challenges in public science communication in South Africa.
During the discussion, the speakers also reflected on the importance of acknowledging intersectional identities, such as those at the intersections of race/ethnicity, gender/sex and social status, when thinking about disparities in science communication and acknowledging contributions of various groups/communities to science enterprise.
The 2023 ISCS took place in-person October 19-21, 2023. Additional virtual sessions took place on Fridays – 9/29/23, 10/6/23, 10/13/23, and 11/3/23.

An AIMS tutor and January intake students attended this conference from 2 to 6 October. The conference was organised by the University of Leeds and the University of Pretoria.
The conference sessions were interesting and discussed topics like utilising artificial intelligence in various disciplines. Notably, AIMS students made contributions through discussions, especially for those doing research related to the conference’s theme.
“During my participation, I presented a comprehensive overview of AIMS, detailing its origins, vision, programmes, and available opportunities. Surprisingly, I discovered that some of the participants didn’t know about AIMS. Some lecturers from the Universities of Leeds and Pretoria showed a desire to volunteer to educate and mentor AIMS students. The conference addressed Africa’s challenges in data science and AI, showcasing initiatives from the University of Leeds. The event emphasized future collaborations between Leeds and Africa to overcome these challenges collectively,” noted Mr Musa Hussien a tutor at AIMS.
Other students wrote the following about their experiences:
“First of all, I’d like to thank AIMS for allowing us to honour the invitation to attend the conference. My experience with the conference started when I was given an opportunity to talk about my AIMS journey. I gained confidence to an extent that I could start explaining my research project to everyone who was there. I attended not only as an AIMS delegate but as an young African who’s eager and hungry to learn ways to change the continent of Africa at large. The moment that stood out for me was when I was chairing the “Bridging the gap between Academia and Industry” unconference session. This made me realise how much potential I have and that I must embrace the self-confidence I have. It also taught me leadership and management.”  Maitielo Reneilwe Maanaso (South Africa)
“Attending the conference was a remarkable experience. The event provided valuable insights into the world of data science, particularly from a mathematical sciences perspective. The knowledge I gained was truly enlightening and will undoubtedly shape the future of data science in Africa.”  Marry Thekhwe (South Africa)
“A world class meeting of scientists across disciplines in one place, demonstrating applications of Data Science and Mathematics. The definition of meaningful research, that improves livelihoods and establishes sustainable development. Emphasising the importance of collaborative work between domains and its unmatched benefits.” Clinton Garayi (Zimbabwe)
“The conference was outstanding. I met numerous individuals from various parts of Africa and Europe. We engaged in insightful discussions and learned a lot from one another. The atmosphere was cordial, and everyone collaborated effectively. The knowledge we gained can be instrumental in benefiting our continent. Attending the conference was a fulfilling experience for me. It became clear that with the right strategy and collective effort, we can harness the power of data science, AI, and mathematics to tackle some of Africa’s challenges. I’m deeply thankful to AIMS and the organisers for allowing me to be part of such a transformative event.” Edmond Malepane (South Africa)
‘The conference was in parts fun, interesting, eye-opening and educative. Moreover, it provided an opportunity to network with the Leeds University academics, an opportunity we wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.” Kukhanya Zondo (Zimbabwe)
“Engaging with brilliant minds from Africa and the UK in the field of data science was truly enlightening. Witnessing the strides being made by Africans in this domain and observing the application of AI and machine learning across various disciplines like astronomy, healthcare, and finance, was inspiring. Noting the gaps that I need to bridge within the field, each day of the conference offered a peek into the future of technology and helped me envision my role within it. I am not only a statistician but also a data scientist, ready to explore and contribute to this evolving field one algorithm at a time.” Oprah Natasha Phiri (Zimbabwe)
‘My experience at the conference led me to understand that Artificial Intelligence can be applied in different sectors such as financial institutions, agriculture, astronomy, health and education.” Neo Kevin Sibuyi (South Africa)

On 1 August, AIMS South Africa welcomed Ms Noluthando Sithole.  She joins the AIMS family as a new intern through the DSI-HSRC Internship Programme 2023/25. The programme offers practical work experience and mentorship to unemployed graduates and postgraduates to gain valuable skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, social sciences and humanities. Noluthando will work closely with Dr Rejoyce Gavhi-Molefe in the planning, implementing, delivering, monitoring, evaluating, and promoting of the House of Science public engagement and women in mathematics projects, amongst other things. 
Noluthando holds a BA in Media Communications and Culture from Nelson Mandela University. She intends to pursue a career in media communication, where she envisions herself taking on roles that allow her to combine her creativity and strategic thinking to develop impactful and engaging content. Reflecting on her internship journey so far, Noluthando described her experience as a bit overwhelming – transitioning to workspace. Nevertheless, the journey has been exciting and eye-opening, helping her learn about AIMS history and ongoing big projects, tools, media platforms, functions, roles, and responsibilities, amongst others. Furthermore, induction workshops offered by DSI-HSRC equipped her with critical elements of career development, the early days of work preparation and the understanding of organisational culture.
“I hope to gain valuable hands-on experience, refine my skills in various aspects of media production, collaborate within a professional team environment and contribute to the House of Science’s growth. I hope to seek some guidance and to be tested within the media aspect of AIMS, which will help me to gain some skills, knowledge and experience in editing, social media posting and public speaking,” said Noluthando
As an intern at AIMS, Noluthando will also benefit immensely from the Pan-African nature of the institute. She will be further afforded an opportunity to engage with renowned African and international academics and researchers, potentially establishing professional relationships and future academic collaborations. Noluthando succeeds Ms. Karabo Makola, a former intern (2019-2020) pursuing a Ph.D. in History of Science at the University of Wuppertal in Germany.

On 22 July,  AIMS, through the House of Science, joined over 70 science, technology and innovation (STI) exhibitors from universities, science councils, national research facilities, industry, science centres, government departments and relevant non-governmental organisations across the country at the official Launch of the 2023 South Africa National Science Week (NSW). NSW is an annual week-long celebration of STI and one of the many Department of Science & Innovation-led activities to build a South African society that is knowledgeable about science, critically engaged and scientifically literate.  2023 NSW  focus week is being celebrated from 31 July to 5 August throughout the country. The theme for NSW 2023 is Transforming lives through evidence-based science. The Launch took place at the University of Venda (UNIVEN) in Limpopo Province.  
The AIMS exhibition stand at the launch featured hands-on activities, posters and presentations to showcase its (AIMS) research, science communication projects, and the importance of mathematical sciences and their application in our daily lives. AIMS exhibitors, which included Dr Joel Lontsi (Postdoctoral Researcher) and Mr Rockefeller (PhD Student in Applied  Maths), engaged with learners, teachers and members of the general public on mind-teasing games, conversations, questions and answers sessions all centred around the use of mathematical sciences. 
Rockefeller recalled a little sentiment of “math-phobia” shown at first by a group of learners probably because of how complex and brain-demanding mathematics may look from the distance. He shared that, a little later on, a sudden enthusiasm and willingness to hear more seemed to engulf their phobia. High school learners and UNIVEN students were pleasantly surprised to see how mathematics plays a crucial role in various domains that have a direct impact on our lives, spanning load-shedding allocation hours (through operational research methods), monitoring of critically endangered species (through machine learning for bioacoustics), improvement of renewable energy prediction methods (through historical consistent state space models) and the preservation of indigenous African languages through neural translation methods just to cite a few. 
“One of the complex tasks of mathematicians is not necessarily our daily battles with differential equations and proofs of theorems, but the conveying of our modest knowledge to a non-expert audience and even more, to kids. It requires hours of repetition, crafting of imaginative examples, and perhaps little brain-teasing games. I believe, when done properly, it triggers engagement, kick-starts conversations, and instills the passion for maths and could be a start of a journey into discovering the language of the universe, to the listeners.” said Rockefeller
The exhibition served as an information desk about AIMS programmes, such as postgraduate training, scientific research and public science engagement. It showcased opportunities available for graduates, learners, teachers, academics and researchers, and promoted the upcoming Siyakhula – a week-long festival aimed at strengthening the mathematical sciences across Africa that will take place from 17-22 March 2024 at AIMS in Muizenberg.
“Rockefeller and I also had the opportunity to speak to students in the Mathematical Department about the Structured Master’s programme at AIMS. We met some very enthusiastic students who are interested in applying to AIMS for the January intake of the Structured Master’s programme. This experience allowed us to rethink how we communicate science and the opportunity to discover another part of South Africa” said Joel.

This School will take place  from 20 November to 1 December 2023 at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa in Muizenberg.
A blockchain is a digital list of data records, comprised by blocks which are organized in chronological order and are linked and secured by cryptographic proofs.
It started  to secure digital documents from data tampering, and quickly  lead to the creation of Bitcoin,  the first decentralized electronic cash system, or cryptocurrency.
The novelty of blockchain technology is providing securily a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger containing all previously confirmed transactions. Some experts consider that decentralization will avoid third party authorities such as  banks, corporations, and insurance companies,  changing dramatically the organizational structures in our global society.
In this school we will focus on two branches of blockchain technology. First, the
development of the particular algorithms to execute transactions consensually, and second the mathematical tools and cryptographic protocols providing the security issues behind this technology.
The school is aimed to make the participants potential contributors to a blockchain society.

Research activity commenced at AIMS South Africa in 2003, mostly through a limited number of short-term research fellowships sponsored by the Ford Foundation, the Victor Rothschild Memorial Fund and the National Research Foundation. However, research at AIMS South Africa started off in earnest after the AIMS South Africa Research Centre was launched during May 2008 (following the purchase and refurbishment of two historical double-storey houses opposite the AIMS main building in Melrose Road) and after a grant was secured from the Department of Science and Technology at the end of 2008.
The Research Centre was launched with the mission to conduct and foster outstanding research and learning in the mathematical sciences, thus contributing to the next generation of pan-African leaders in many spheres and the advancement of African science and academia within a multicultural environment.
This is achieved by creating a research environment with focused themes; integrating research with postgraduate training and developing young researchers; and providing a space for mathematical scientists to work together and interact with local and international researchers within their focus framework. 
The research conducted has a strong focus on cutting-edge topics which relate to mathematical modelling in a multi-disciplinary context. In particular those that are most relevant to African development, especially in fields where scientists in Africa have a competitive advantage and can do world-leading research. 
Research is focused on the following areas:
Close involvement with local universities and other research institutions is encouraged, thus widening the pool of available expertise and serving to initiate long-term research programmes in the local academic community. Researchers also collaborate with international experts in their field and with researchers in Africa to ensure strong pan-African participation in the Centre’s programmes, and to stimulate the growth of pan-African research networks and partnerships.
We also maintain close ties with industry by running programmes associated with particular industrial needs, assisting in capacity building and collaboration on innovative projects.

The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) is Africa’s first network of centres of excellence in mathematical sciences. We enable the continent’s youth to shape the continent’s future through Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) education- training Africa’s next generation of leaders. AIMS South Africa is one of the centres of excellence for training, research and public engagement in Cape Town, South Africa. AIMS South Africa was established in 2003 as a partnership project of the following 6 universities: Cambridge, Cape Town, Oxford, Paris Sud XI, Stellenbosch, and Western Cape.

“We believe that the next Einstein will be African and that he or she will develop solutions that cross borders and change lives.”
AIMS is incubating mathematical sciences to address global challenges. We offer a structured Master’s in mathematical sciences and are focused on scientific training, cutting-edge research and public engagement. Our activities include:

To implement its vision, AIMS targets the brightest young African students, shaping them as independent thinkers, and problem-solvers capable of innovating and propelling Africa to economic prosperity. Africa’s youth are at the heart of the innovation and transformation ecosystem which consists of a set of academic and non-academic programs expertly tailored to provide AIMS learners with a unique post-graduate training experience on the continent.
The AIMS model is unique in its pan-African focus, broad curriculum, focus on independent critical thinking, inclusion of modern computational techniques and research components. AIMS identifies top African graduates and provides them with a world class education in mathematical sciences, enabling them to purse careers in research, industry and civil society. Students benefit from full bursary support, continuous access to computing, internet and electricity, close interaction with full-time tutors and visiting professors, as well as a bilingual education. Endorsed by NEPAD, the African Union and TED as an idea big enough to change the world, this model has been refined and proven at 6 AIMS Centres of Excellence in South Africa, Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and Rwanda, with over 1500 graduates gone onto careers all over Africa, as researchers, teachers, epidemiologists, business people and financial modelers, in addition to a gender-responsive Teacher Training.
AIMS equally created two critical initiatives: Quantum Leap Africa to prepare the continent for the coming quantum revolution and the Next Einstein Forum to propel Africa on to the global scientific stage.

AIMS South Africa has trained a total of 919 students since its inception in 2003. Our students benefit from the experience of renowned visiting lecturers who teach for three weeks in turn. Capacity building is provided by tutors who are always available on campus to ensure a 24-hour learning environment. 
With backgrounds in mathematics, engineering, physics, computer science, as well as actuarial science, our students come from 41 African countries. 
The table below shows the top 10 Alumni nationalities at AIMS South Africa.


“We should not underestimate the value of this feeling that AIMS is an institute in which we are all learning and teaching together with the common goal of sharing our knowledge and experiences with each other.”
The main AIMS South Africa building is a self-contained residential centre with excellent computer, library and lecturing facilities. Lecturers and students live and dine in the main building, allowing for maximum contact time in an informal and collegiate setting. 

AIMS tuition, study materials and housing are fully funded through a generous scholarship. AIMS’ residential nature allows more contact time between lecturers and students than is available in a typical university setting.
Students typically study two subjects for three weeks each, with each day comprising morning lectures followed by problem-solving and computing sessions each afternoon. Additional tutorials and special lectures are held in the evenings when students also usually complete their assignments.
All lectures at AIMS South Africa are presented in English. AIMS regards communication skills as a crucial part of the training both in respect of the spoken language and thewritten language. As English is not the first language of many of the students, English Language classes, taught by the Language and Communications Teacher, at various levels, are available and held regularly, particularly at the beginning of the academic year.
All AIMS students are required to invest at least 20 hours in community service activities during the academic year to strengthen their leadership skills as well as their commitment to give-back to Africa.
AIMS South Africa is located in Muizenberg, a small seaside resort and surfers paradise and an area of outstanding natural beauty. 
AIMS South Africa is ideally situated within 100 metres of the sea. There is a good train connection to Cape Town city centre and to Simonstown, a picturesque naval base and how to a growing African penguin colony. The road through Simonstown will take you to a Nature Reserve at Cape Point. Cape Town is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and much of it can be explored using Muizenberg as a base.
The site is a half hour drive away from the three local Universities, the centre of Cape Town and Cape Town international airport. 
AIMS South Africa is proud to have produced 870 graduates, 35% of whom are women. Our alumni represent 41 countries, and are serving as leaders in academia and industry.

AIMS South Africa offers an intensive one-year postgraduate course leading to a Structured Master’s in Mathematical Sciences, formally accredited by the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, and the Western Cape. The programme is taught in association with the faculty of the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Paris Sud XI.
AI for Science is a new stream in AIMS South Africa’s Master’s degree in Mathematical Science, made possible through a partnership with DeepMind and is being introduced as part of the August 2023 intake. 
The course provides both a broad overview of cutting-edge sciences and strong mathematical and computing research skills. The course is unique, offering students exposure to a range of topics, thereby allowing them to make an informed choice as to their future specialisation. The goal is to develop well-rounded scientists, with excellent problem-solving skills, capable of creative thinking and genuine innovation. There is a strong grounding in end-to-end skills, from problem formulation, estimation, prioritization, and generally applicable mathematical and computing methods, through to clear and concise scientific report writing. A number of modules which also make the course interesting and relevant to prospective mathematics and science teachers have been included.
Faculties from the nearby Universities of the Western Cape, Cape Town and Stellenbosch have been intimately involved in developing the AIMS course. World-leading scientists and educators have volunteered to teach at AIMS. Their participation ensures an education of the highest international quality. Tutors (often including alumni) provide teaching and administrative assistance, assistance to foreign language speakers, and continuity across the visiting lecturers.
Students are registered at one of the three local universities: Cape Town, Stellenbosch or Western Cape.
Completing a course of such scope and depth in just one academic year is possible only if it is highly intensive, so students must come prepared to work hard and focus. The residential nature of AIMS allows far greater contact time between lecturers and students than normally available in a university setting. Courses are student-centered but very demanding. Students study two subjects at a time every three weeks, with morning lectures and related afternoon problem solving and computing sessions. Each course consists of 30 hours contact time (10 per week). Additional tutorials and special lectures are often held in the evenings, when students complete their assignments.
No special preparation for the course is needed on a student’s part. However, the working language is English and foreign students are advised to take an English language course before arrival. The course also carries a large component of scientific computing, and many hours are spent in the computer lab; students who have improved their touch typing skills before the programme will have a distinct advantage.
At AIMS South Africa there are two intakes each year (January and August). The curriculum runs over 3 semesters described below. There is an oral defense of the research project at the end of the academic year followed by a graduation ceremony.
These are designed to provide introductory and foundational material to the students, and are structured to achieve pre-defined outcomes, with little flexibility in their content. All courses are compulsory.
These are fundamentally different in that they include a wide range of topical issues and are more flexibly designed. Students are required to complete 2 out of the 3 available review courses in each time slot, a total of 12. The 3 choices in each time slot will be balanced with respect to focus on mathematics, physics and interdisciplinary topics such as computer science, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and more. The ongoing communication skills and computing classes are compulsory:

During the three-month long Research project students work on a research topic with a supervisor, usually from a South African university. Students are not expected to do original work to achieve a passing grade. However, the criterion for an outstanding research project is broadly that it could constitute the early part of a Research Master’s thesis. For example, it could be publishable in a journal, or form an outstanding introduction to the field that could be used by other students entering the area.During this phase targeted communication skills and computing classes may continue, at the lecturers’ discretion.

The AIMS mission is to provide an excellent, advanced education to talented and highly motivated African students in order to develop independent thinkers, researchers and problem solvers who will contribute to Africa’s development. One of the key features of studying at AIMS is the highly enriching experience of students and lecturers eating and living together within a 24 hour learning environment, and the consequent friendly and informal atmosphere, coupled with active and meaningful participation during the teaching sessions.
Each year AIMS South Africa takes approximately 70 students from around twenty five different African countries with a complete mix of race, religion and gender. There are two intakes a year, one in January and the other in mid-August. By far the most common response to the question ”What does your year at AIMS really mean to you?” is ”the opportunity to meet, and live with, people from all over the African continent, and to meet, and get to know, the lecturers as individuals”. We should not underestimate the value of this feeling that AIMS is an institute in which we are all learning and teaching together with the common goal of sharing our knowledge and experienceswith each other.
The teaching at AIMS is based on the principle of learning and understanding, rather than simply listening and writing,during classes; and on creating an atmosphere of increasing knowledge through small group discussions. This is achieved by formulating conjectures and assessing the evidence for them, and sometimes going down wrong paths and learning from these mistakes. The essential feature of the classes at AIMS is that, in contrast to formal lecture courses, they are highly interactive; and time is allocated for class discussions. In this way, AIMS provides a climate of interactive teaching, where students are encouraged to learn together in a journey of questioning and discovery, and where lecturers respond to the needs of the class rather than to a pre-determined syllabus. The AIMS teaching philosophy is to promote critical and creative thinking; to experience the excitement of learning from true understanding; and to avoid rote learning directed only towards assessment. Students are helped and encouraged to develop their own ideas, both during and outside formal class times, and to absorb new ideas instead of being presented with the finished product. The teaching at AIMS is done through self-contained (modular) courses in which the advertised content is used as a guide, and lecturers are encouraged, and expected, to adapt daily to meet the needs of the students. The challenge for the lecturers is to create a sense of enquiry in all students who come from very diverse backgrounds. Each student should develop, and succeed, from their own particular starting point. AIMS considers the journey undertaken to reach a conclusion to be as important as the conclusion itself.
All lectures at AIMS South Africa are presented in English. AIMS regards communication skills as a crucial part of the training both in respect of the spoken language and the written language. As English is not the first language of many of the students, English Language classes, taught by the Language and Communications Teacher, at various levels, are available and held regularly, particularly at the beginning of the academic year. Each student is required to give at least one 15-minute presentation, on a mathematical topic related to one of the courses, to the whole class with the help and advice of one of the lecturers. Sessions on scientific writing are also held – particularly near the research-project phase.

The AIMS Associate Faculty recognises lecturers who have made significant contributions at AIMS, not only through lecturing a course more than once, but also through additional engagement in AIMS’ activities. Members are appointed for four years and can be reappointed.


The AIMS Master’s in Mathematical Sciences includes a research project, which makes up one third of the course.
The purpose of an AIMS research project is:
The project contains a survey of literature and methods at the forefront of some topic appropriate for a student beginning research in the Mathematical Sciences. It typically contains examples, perhaps by computation/simulation, and some independent work. Ideally the topic will prepare the student for a research MSc or a PhD, or to follow a career in commerce, industry or the government sector. 
The project phase lasts three months. In the initial stages of the project students will still be taking courses. This is the time during which students are expected to complete background reading for their project. When courses finish they have six weeks to dedicate to the project; this is the time when interaction with the supervisor is most frequent (weekly is the norm), and when the work and writing up is done. Each student is assigned a tutor for support; however the tutor is not a co-supervisor.
There are two student intakes, August intake and January intake. Proposal submissions and project start/end differ depending on the intake. The following table shows the typical schedule for a given academic year:
Supervisors can be fully remote or based in South-Africa. Both are encouraged. Remote supervisors give the students the opportunity to connect with the international scientific community. 
Supervisors should be well versed in the field within which the project is proposed. They are expected to guide students in their research projects and to help clarify difficult concepts.
The supervisor is expected to be available during the three months of the research project. Weekly interactions are the norm. The supervisor shall guide the student and respond in a timely manner to queries and to comment on drafts.
The final evaluation is a 15 to 20 minutes and thereafter responds to questions and discussion provided by the supervisor and other examiners. The supervisor is also expected to be present for the examination, either on Zoom/Skype for remote supervisors or locally. 

Teaching assistants are a fundamental feature of the AIMS model. AIMS South Africa appoints between eight and ten advanced postgraduate students as teaching assistants. Briefly, the duties of the teaching assistants are to provide assistance to the Academic Director and lecturers in matters concerning the academic programme and the assessment of students. Teaching assistants attend the lecture courses; arrange additional tutorials; assist with the marking of assignments; and assist the students with computing and research project writing. Teaching assistants also provide useful information to assist the Academic Director (and sometimes lecturers, who are under no obligation to provide references for students) when writing student references. Teaching assistants are recruited via an announcement through AIMS’ mailing lists.Criteria considered for selection include: academic achievement, ability to speak relevant languages, and an ability to function in the unusual AIMS teaching environment.
Appointments will normally be made for a minimum duration of one full academic year, which runs from mid-August until the end of June.
Duties
Providing general assistance to the director and the lecturers within the academic program, for example in assisting with problem-solving classes and computer labs, in providing group and personal tutorials where needed, in contributing to the assessment of student performance on a continuous basis, in preparing additional materials, examples and extra classes as needed.
Requirements
At least a Master’s in one of the mathematical sciences; superior teaching ability/skills; excellent interpersonal skills; innovative flair; excellent command of English and/or French; ability to work as a dedicated member of a team where responsibility is shared. Knowledge of an additional language, in particular Arabic, would be an advantage.

The Industry Immersion Program was launched in 2017, in partnership with the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), Berlin, and with funding support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ) through the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
The program transfers competencies from one of Europe’s leading business schools and develops business links between African graduates and German businesses operating in Africa through internship and post-graduate employment.
Towards the end of 2020, the organization partnered with Academics Without Borders (AWB) in Canada, whose mission is to help developing countries improve their universities so that they can train their own experts (train the trainer) and conduct research to assist in their countries development. So far, AWB has proven to be a very reliable partner in her scaling prospects. Through their efforts, we partnered with Strathmore University to run the IIP in 2021 and 2022.
In 2022, we ran the program in 6 African countries, transferring competencies to 100 cohorts of Students. This is a landmark achievement in IIP’s scaling effort.   
Highlights of the program include the opportunity for qualified and industry-oriented AIMS graduating students and AIMS alumni to participate in a fully-funded 20-week residential Industry Immersion Program that offers the opportunity to contribute to the economic transformation of Africa through a practical, skills-based employability program.
Participants will gain the necessary managerial and organizational skills and behavioral competencies suitable for employment. The program offers a mixture of academic and practical learning and skills development which will allow participants to transition from a scientific environment to an applied industry setting.
The backbone of the program is a 12-week internship module with participating industry partners, beginning five weeks after the program starts, during which participants will experience a business environment firsthand and apply their academic learning. Companies will also undertake a team-based consulting project with a group of interns.
Please click here for more information.
The 2023 program will start at the beginning of July at AIMS South Africa. Applications from AIMS Alumni and students with an interest in business are welcome.

Understanding Fluid Flow takes a fresh approach to introducing fluid dynamics, with physical reasoning and mathematical developments inextricably intertwined. The ‘dry’ fluid dynamics described by potential theory is set within the context of real viscous flows to give fundamental insight into how fluids behave.  The book gives a flavour of theoretical, experimental and numerical approaches to analysing fluid flow, and implicitly develops skills in applied mathematical modelling of physical systems. It is supplemented by movies that are freely downloadable.

Mathematical Explorations follows on from the author’s previous book, Creative Mathematics, in the same series, and gives the reader experience in working on problems requiring a little more mathematical maturity. The author’s main aim is to show that problems are often solved by using mathematics that is not obviously connected to the problem, and readers are encouraged to consider as wide a variety of mathematical ideas as possible. In each case, the emphasis is placed on the important underlying ideas rather than on the solutions for their own sake. To enhance understanding of how mathematical research is conducted, each problem has been chosen not for its mathematical importance, but because it provides a good illustration of how arguments can be developed. While the reader does not require a deep mathematical background to tackle these problems, they will find their mathematical understanding is enriched by attempting to solve them.

Research activity commenced at AIMS South Africa in 2003, mostly through a limited number of short-term research fellowships sponsored by the Ford Foundation, the Victor Rothschild Memorial Fund and the National Research Foundation. However, research at AIMS South Africa started off in earnest after the AIMS South Africa Research Centre was launched during May 2008 (following the purchase and refurbishment of two historical double-storey houses opposite the AIMS main building in Melrose Road) and after a grant was secured from the Department of Science and Technology at the end of 2008.
The Research Centre was launched with the mission to conduct and foster outstanding research and learning in the mathematical sciences, thus contributing to the next generation of pan-African leaders in many spheres and the advancement of African science and academia within a multicultural environment.
This is achieved by creating a research environment with focused themes; integrating research with postgraduate training and developing young researchers; and providing a space for mathematical scientists to work together and interact with local and international researchers within their focus framework. 
The research conducted has a strong focus on cutting-edge topics which relate to mathematical modelling in a multi-disciplinary context. In particular those that are most relevant to African development, especially in fields where scientists in Africa have a competitive advantage and can do world-leading research. 
Research is focused on the following areas:
Close involvement with local universities and other research institutions is encouraged, thus widening the pool of available expertise and serving to initiate long-term research programmes in the local academic community. Researchers also collaborate with international experts in their field and with researchers in Africa to ensure strong pan-African participation in the Centre’s programmes, and to stimulate the growth of pan-African research networks and partnerships.
We also maintain close ties with industry by running programmes associated with particular industrial needs, assisting in capacity building and collaboration on innovative projects.

Harness the potential of young scientists impassioned about discovery and inspired by the promise of a new future for Africa.
AIMS South Africa selects the best students from a large pool of applications each year. The goal of this unique course is to develop well-rounded African scientists, with excellent problem-solving skills, capable of creative thinking and genuine innovation.
One of the most crucial aspects of the AIMS model is our ability to provide scholarships to students across Africa. All AIMS students receive bursaries which cover travel, accommodation, meals, medical insurance, tuition, university registration fees and a modest monthly stipend. Without this scholarship many deserving students would not be able to take up this life-changing opportunity.
For as little as $20 a month you could cover a student’s stipend each month or a once off gift of $100 would cover medical aid for one student for the year.
Our graduates are developing solutions that cross borders and change lives. With your help we can harness the potential of young scientists impassioned about discovery and inspired by the promise of a new future for Africa.

Overview of 2017 Biomaths courses (towards Honours) offered at AIMS
The Honours in Mathematical Biology course is jointly run by the Stelllenbosch University’s Department of Mathematical Sciences and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).  The application procedure and form is available via Stellenbosch University’s Science Faculty webpage  under Information for Students, Postgraduate Programmes, and the Department of Mathematical Sciences website, under Honours courses. 
South African students with a good BSc majoring in Mathematics, and (at least) some courses in a biological/biomedical field, or an equivalent qualification, can apply. 
For more information please send an email to biomath-info@aims.ac.za.

This page allows you to submit a proposal for one or more courses which you would like to teach at any AIMS centre. There will be slight flexibility at each centre and some differences between centres’ exact programmes. Programmes are finalised in discussion with the director and/or curriculum committee at each centre.
Please read the following information carefully before proceeding to the application page
The AIMS Structured Master’s in Mathematical Sciences Programme commences in September each year at all centres. AIMS South Africa offers a second intake commencing in January for South African students. Prospective lecturers are advised to submit proposals by 28 February for courses in the programme starting the following September (or January). Selection of courses will take place during March and April and all proposers will have been advised of the outcome in early June.
As there are many more course proposals than available course slots, the submission of a course proposal does not guarantee automatic acceptance into the curriculum. The AIMS governing bodies reserve the right to actively recruit additional lecturers and schedule additional courses on an ad-hoc basis, in order to ensure a well-balanced course of the highest possible quality.
After an introductory week, the curriculum for the AIMS Master’s in Mathematical Sciences is divided into three categories: skills courses and review courses followed by a research project (where no formal courses are taught). These run in parallel with some continuous communication and computing classes presented by AIMS staff during all phases. Proposals are solicited for the skills and review courses. Each course will consist of 30 hours contact time (10 per week), that is approximately 15 to 18 hours lecturing with additional time (12 to 15 hours) for discussion and practical/tutorial work.
Skills courses are designed to provide introductory and foundational material to the students, and are structured to achieve pre-defined outcomes, with little flexibility in their content. The time slots during which the skills courses will be taught are provisional as in the typical skills course programme at AIMS South Africa shown below. The order of these courses often varies. Exact dates could differ at the different AIMS centres.
Review courses are fundamentally different in that they are designed to offer opportunities to teach on a wide range of topical issues. Lecturers thus have flexibility in designing their courses, subject to the guidelines set out below. Review courses will be taught from December through March in the time slots outlined below. The 3 courses in each time unit are usually balanced with respect to focus on mathematics, physics and interdisciplinary topics.
You will be given the opportunity to choose one or more time slots within which you would be prepared to teach your review course. The more time slots you are available for, the greater the chance of being selected.
During the review phase each student gives a presentation of 10 or 15 mins, with 5 mins of questions/discussion. Although the vehicle for the presentation is a topic related to the course, emphasis is on style (addressing the audience, clear slides, good selection of material, and fielding of questions, etc.). Together with briefer presentationsgiven in the skills course IT & LaTeX, this helps to prepare students for the oral defense at the end of the year.
Students book a presentation in a course with the lecturer, usually on the first day of the course (first come, first served). Sometimes they have an idea of what they want to talk about, in which case the lecturer need only make a note of the student name and topic (to give to the head tutor). But sometimes they have no idea of topic, only that they like the course area. In that case the leturer suggests a topic, with references. It may be to summarise a further topic in the course, or related material; or to present a proof omitted in the course. The topic is less important than the delivery.
On average each course attracts three presentations, which are usually scheduled in the last hour of the course (since that is least intrusive). In the middle week of the course the lecturer checks that the student is progressing with preparation for the presentation, and may listen to a practice.
During the Research project phase students work on a research topic with a supervisor.
AIMS encourages, but does not require, cooperation between local and international lecturers. The form therefore permits you to enter the email address of a co-lecturer. AIMS provides several teaching assistants throughout the year, but in some (rare) cases, lecturers may wish to bring an advanced masters or PhD student of theirs along to assist, e.g. with a particularly challenging practical or computational component of the course.

The AIMS curriculum is extremely ambitious in attempting to provide students from very diverse backgrounds with excellent mathematics and computing research skills plus a broad overview of cutting-edge sciences, all within a very limited period.
Such an outcome is achievable only if full advantage is taken of the self-contained, residential nature of the AIMS institute which allows for greater contact time and interaction between students and lecturers than would normally be possible within a conventional university setting.
The intensive lectures-plus-tutorial-per-day format that is envisaged for AIMS courses implies that courses will have to cover fewer topics (as compared to normal graduate equivalents), and instead concentrate on covering fundamental results and techniques thoroughly in a participatory tutorial and problem-solving style.
Due to the diversity of students and topics, courses need to be highly student-centered i.e. unusually sensitive and responsive to the needs of the students. All courses should

In keeping with the above, the duties involved in teaching a course at AIMS will include

Teaching assistants are a fundamental feature of the AIMS model. AIMS South Africa appoints between eight and ten advanced postgraduate students as teaching assistants. Briefly, the duties of the teaching assistants are to provide assistance to the Academic Director and lecturers in matters concerning the academic programme and the assessment of students. Teaching assistants attend the lecture courses; arrange additional tutorials; assist with the marking of assignments; and assist the students with computing and research project writing. Teaching assistants also provide useful information to assist the Academic Director (and sometimes lecturers, who are under no obligation to provide references for students) when writing student references. Teaching assistants are recruited via an announcement through AIMS’ mailing lists.Criteria considered for selection include: academic achievement, ability to speak relevant languages, and an ability to function in the unusual AIMS teaching environment.
Appointments will normally be made for a minimum duration of one full academic year, which runs from mid-August until the end of June.
Duties
Providing general assistance to the director and the lecturers within the academic program, for example in assisting with problem-solving classes and computer labs, in providing group and personal tutorials where needed, in contributing to the assessment of student performance on a continuous basis, in preparing additional materials, examples and extra classes as needed.
Requirements
At least a Master’s in one of the mathematical sciences; superior teaching ability/skills; excellent interpersonal skills; innovative flair; excellent command of English and/or French; ability to work as a dedicated member of a team where responsibility is shared. Knowledge of an additional language, in particular Arabic, would be an advantage.
Computer skills
Linux, SAGE or SciPy.
Applications

The AIMS Master’s in Mathematical Sciences includes a research project, which makes up one third of the course.
The purpose of an AIMS research project is:
The project contains a survey of literature and methods at the forefront of some topic appropriate for a student beginning research in the Mathematical Sciences. It typically contains examples, perhaps by computation/simulation, and some independent work. Ideally the topic will prepare the student for a research MSc or a PhD, or to follow a career in commerce, industry or the government sector. 
The project phase lasts three months. In the initial stages of the project students will still be taking courses. This is the time during which students are expected to complete background reading for their project. When courses finish they have six weeks to dedicate to the project; this is the time when interaction with the supervisor is most frequent (weekly is the norm), and when the work and writing up is done. Each student is assigned a tutor for support; however the tutor is not a co-supervisor.
There are two student intakes, August intake and January intake. Proposal submissions and project start/end differ depending on the intake. The following table shows the typical schedule for a given academic year:
Supervisors can be fully remote or based in South-Africa. Both are encouraged. Remote supervisors give the students the opportunity to connect with the international scientific community. 
Supervisors should be well versed in the field within which the project is proposed. They are expected to guide students in their research projects and to help clarify difficult concepts.
The supervisor is expected to be available during the three months of the research project. Weekly interactions are the norm. The supervisor shall guide the student and respond in a timely manner to queries and to comment on drafts.
The final evaluation is a 15 to 20 minutes and thereafter responds to questions and discussion provided by the supervisor and other examiners. The supervisor is also expected to be present for the examination, either on Zoom/Skype for remote supervisors or locally. 

The AIMS South Africa Research Centre offers Doctoral and Masters bursaries for research study in the Centre (details on the research areas supported at the Research Centre may be found at Research). South African students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds are especially welcome.

Blurring Global North/South Boundaries in Advancement of Equity and Inclusion through Science Communication Practices and Research
The Inclusive SciComm Symposium (ISCS) conference is an ever-evolving and expansive conference that advocates for science communication that prioritizes equity, inclusion, and intersectionality. It (ISCS) aims to build a community that actively challenges the dominant, marginalizing norms of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). 
The 2023 ISCS, hosted in hybrid format by the University of Rhode Island’s Metcalf Institute in Kingston, USA, included a virtual session on “Blurring global North/South boundaries in science communication: mainstreaming epistemic diversity, decolonization, and multilingualism”. The session took place on 13th October and was organised by Rejoyce Gavhi-Molefe, AIMS House of Science Manager, and three other early-career scientists from a variety of Global South backgrounds and/or countries, namely Siddharth Kankaria (India), Sofía Gutiérrez (Mexico), Odon Akanimo (based in the UK; originally from Nigeria) and John Noel Viana (based in Australia; originally from the Philippines). The session was supported by the African Gong – Pan-African Network for the Popularization of Science & Technology and Science Communication in Africa, the Center for Diverse Leadership in Science at UCLA – University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute.  
The virtual session, which was co-moderated by Rejoyce and Siddharth, collated learnings and insights from the four speakers’ recent contributions to a Bristol University Press book on Race & Sociocultural Inclusion in Science Communication and their diverse, intersectional lived experiences.  Rejoyce’s contribution to the session focused on the challenges and opportunities concerning advancing scientific research and its communication/dissemination to the broader public in South Africa and on the continent. It provided some insights on how the capacity-building programme, “Africa Scientifique: Leadership, Knowledge & Skills for Science Communication”, delivered annually to the cohort of AIMS South Africa Master’s students since 2020, is addressing the gaps and challenges in public science communication in South Africa.
During the discussion, the speakers also reflected on the importance of acknowledging intersectional identities, such as those at the intersections of race/ethnicity, gender/sex and social status, when thinking about disparities in science communication and acknowledging contributions of various groups/communities to science enterprise.
The 2023 ISCS took place in-person October 19-21, 2023. Additional virtual sessions took place on Fridays – 9/29/23, 10/6/23, 10/13/23, and 11/3/23.

An AIMS tutor and January intake students attended this conference from 2 to 6 October. The conference was organised by the University of Leeds and the University of Pretoria.
The conference sessions were interesting and discussed topics like utilising artificial intelligence in various disciplines. Notably, AIMS students made contributions through discussions, especially for those doing research related to the conference’s theme.
“During my participation, I presented a comprehensive overview of AIMS, detailing its origins, vision, programmes, and available opportunities. Surprisingly, I discovered that some of the participants didn’t know about AIMS. Some lecturers from the Universities of Leeds and Pretoria showed a desire to volunteer to educate and mentor AIMS students. The conference addressed Africa’s challenges in data science and AI, showcasing initiatives from the University of Leeds. The event emphasized future collaborations between Leeds and Africa to overcome these challenges collectively,” noted Mr Musa Hussien a tutor at AIMS.
Other students wrote the following about their experiences:
“First of all, I’d like to thank AIMS for allowing us to honour the invitation to attend the conference. My experience with the conference started when I was given an opportunity to talk about my AIMS journey. I gained confidence to an extent that I could start explaining my research project to everyone who was there. I attended not only as an AIMS delegate but as an young African who’s eager and hungry to learn ways to change the continent of Africa at large. The moment that stood out for me was when I was chairing the “Bridging the gap between Academia and Industry” unconference session. This made me realise how much potential I have and that I must embrace the self-confidence I have. It also taught me leadership and management.”  Maitielo Reneilwe Maanaso (South Africa)
“Attending the conference was a remarkable experience. The event provided valuable insights into the world of data science, particularly from a mathematical sciences perspective. The knowledge I gained was truly enlightening and will undoubtedly shape the future of data science in Africa.”  Marry Thekhwe (South Africa)
“A world class meeting of scientists across disciplines in one place, demonstrating applications of Data Science and Mathematics. The definition of meaningful research, that improves livelihoods and establishes sustainable development. Emphasising the importance of collaborative work between domains and its unmatched benefits.” Clinton Garayi (Zimbabwe)
“The conference was outstanding. I met numerous individuals from various parts of Africa and Europe. We engaged in insightful discussions and learned a lot from one another. The atmosphere was cordial, and everyone collaborated effectively. The knowledge we gained can be instrumental in benefiting our continent. Attending the conference was a fulfilling experience for me. It became clear that with the right strategy and collective effort, we can harness the power of data science, AI, and mathematics to tackle some of Africa’s challenges. I’m deeply thankful to AIMS and the organisers for allowing me to be part of such a transformative event.” Edmond Malepane (South Africa)
‘The conference was in parts fun, interesting, eye-opening and educative. Moreover, it provided an opportunity to network with the Leeds University academics, an opportunity we wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.” Kukhanya Zondo (Zimbabwe)
“Engaging with brilliant minds from Africa and the UK in the field of data science was truly enlightening. Witnessing the strides being made by Africans in this domain and observing the application of AI and machine learning across various disciplines like astronomy, healthcare, and finance, was inspiring. Noting the gaps that I need to bridge within the field, each day of the conference offered a peek into the future of technology and helped me envision my role within it. I am not only a statistician but also a data scientist, ready to explore and contribute to this evolving field one algorithm at a time.” Oprah Natasha Phiri (Zimbabwe)
‘My experience at the conference led me to understand that Artificial Intelligence can be applied in different sectors such as financial institutions, agriculture, astronomy, health and education.” Neo Kevin Sibuyi (South Africa)

On 1 August, AIMS South Africa welcomed Ms Noluthando Sithole.  She joins the AIMS family as a new intern through the DSI-HSRC Internship Programme 2023/25. The programme offers practical work experience and mentorship to unemployed graduates and postgraduates to gain valuable skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, social sciences and humanities. Noluthando will work closely with Dr Rejoyce Gavhi-Molefe in the planning, implementing, delivering, monitoring, evaluating, and promoting of the House of Science public engagement and women in mathematics projects, amongst other things. 
Noluthando holds a BA in Media Communications and Culture from Nelson Mandela University. She intends to pursue a career in media communication, where she envisions herself taking on roles that allow her to combine her creativity and strategic thinking to develop impactful and engaging content. Reflecting on her internship journey so far, Noluthando described her experience as a bit overwhelming – transitioning to workspace. Nevertheless, the journey has been exciting and eye-opening, helping her learn about AIMS history and ongoing big projects, tools, media platforms, functions, roles, and responsibilities, amongst others. Furthermore, induction workshops offered by DSI-HSRC equipped her with critical elements of career development, the early days of work preparation and the understanding of organisational culture.
“I hope to gain valuable hands-on experience, refine my skills in various aspects of media production, collaborate within a professional team environment and contribute to the House of Science’s growth. I hope to seek some guidance and to be tested within the media aspect of AIMS, which will help me to gain some skills, knowledge and experience in editing, social media posting and public speaking,” said Noluthando
As an intern at AIMS, Noluthando will also benefit immensely from the Pan-African nature of the institute. She will be further afforded an opportunity to engage with renowned African and international academics and researchers, potentially establishing professional relationships and future academic collaborations. Noluthando succeeds Ms. Karabo Makola, a former intern (2019-2020) pursuing a Ph.D. in History of Science at the University of Wuppertal in Germany.

On 22 July,  AIMS, through the House of Science, joined over 70 science, technology and innovation (STI) exhibitors from universities, science councils, national research facilities, industry, science centres, government departments and relevant non-governmental organisations across the country at the official Launch of the 2023 South Africa National Science Week (NSW). NSW is an annual week-long celebration of STI and one of the many Department of Science & Innovation-led activities to build a South African society that is knowledgeable about science, critically engaged and scientifically literate.  2023 NSW  focus week is being celebrated from 31 July to 5 August throughout the country. The theme for NSW 2023 is Transforming lives through evidence-based science. The Launch took place at the University of Venda (UNIVEN) in Limpopo Province.  
The AIMS exhibition stand at the launch featured hands-on activities, posters and presentations to showcase its (AIMS) research, science communication projects, and the importance of mathematical sciences and their application in our daily lives. AIMS exhibitors, which included Dr Joel Lontsi (Postdoctoral Researcher) and Mr Rockefeller (PhD Student in Applied  Maths), engaged with learners, teachers and members of the general public on mind-teasing games, conversations, questions and answers sessions all centred around the use of mathematical sciences. 
Rockefeller recalled a little sentiment of “math-phobia” shown at first by a group of learners probably because of how complex and brain-demanding mathematics may look from the distance. He shared that, a little later on, a sudden enthusiasm and willingness to hear more seemed to engulf their phobia. High school learners and UNIVEN students were pleasantly surprised to see how mathematics plays a crucial role in various domains that have a direct impact on our lives, spanning load-shedding allocation hours (through operational research methods), monitoring of critically endangered species (through machine learning for bioacoustics), improvement of renewable energy prediction methods (through historical consistent state space models) and the preservation of indigenous African languages through neural translation methods just to cite a few. 
“One of the complex tasks of mathematicians is not necessarily our daily battles with differential equations and proofs of theorems, but the conveying of our modest knowledge to a non-expert audience and even more, to kids. It requires hours of repetition, crafting of imaginative examples, and perhaps little brain-teasing games. I believe, when done properly, it triggers engagement, kick-starts conversations, and instills the passion for maths and could be a start of a journey into discovering the language of the universe, to the listeners.” said Rockefeller
The exhibition served as an information desk about AIMS programmes, such as postgraduate training, scientific research and public science engagement. It showcased opportunities available for graduates, learners, teachers, academics and researchers, and promoted the upcoming Siyakhula – a week-long festival aimed at strengthening the mathematical sciences across Africa that will take place from 17-22 March 2024 at AIMS in Muizenberg.
“Rockefeller and I also had the opportunity to speak to students in the Mathematical Department about the Structured Master’s programme at AIMS. We met some very enthusiastic students who are interested in applying to AIMS for the January intake of the Structured Master’s programme. This experience allowed us to rethink how we communicate science and the opportunity to discover another part of South Africa” said Joel.

This School will take place  from 20 November to 1 December 2023 at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa in Muizenberg.
A blockchain is a digital list of data records, comprised by blocks which are organized in chronological order and are linked and secured by cryptographic proofs.
It started  to secure digital documents from data tampering, and quickly  lead to the creation of Bitcoin,  the first decentralized electronic cash system, or cryptocurrency.
The novelty of blockchain technology is providing securily a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger containing all previously confirmed transactions. Some experts consider that decentralization will avoid third party authorities such as  banks, corporations, and insurance companies,  changing dramatically the organizational structures in our global society.
In this school we will focus on two branches of blockchain technology. First, the
development of the particular algorithms to execute transactions consensually, and second the mathematical tools and cryptographic protocols providing the security issues behind this technology.
The school is aimed to make the participants potential contributors to a blockchain society.

The AIMS South Africa is a residential graduate mathematics institute in Muizenberg. We have around 90 taught Master’s students, as well as research-based Master’s and PhD students. Our research centre hosts postdoctoral fellows and other research staff. Our students are drawn from across Africa. AIMS relies on the support of visiting international lecturers, who usually stay on site with our students.
AIMS was founded in Cape Town in 2003 as a collaborative partnership between the University of Cape Town, Stellenbosch University and the University of the Western Cape to offer tailored graduate-level educational programmes, conduct cutting-edge research and to share mathematics with the wider community. AIMS is now a pan-African network of centres of excellence for postgraduate training, research and educational public outreach in mathematical sciences. Four additional AIMS centres have been established in Senegal (2011), Ghana (2012), Cameroon (2013) and Rwanda (2016). To date, the AIMS network has graduated more than 3000 alumni from 42 African countries through its structured Master’s programme.
As a place to work, AIMS offers a dynamic, international environment. We are a tight-knit community. Staff can share lunch with lecturers and students. Some of our staff have been part of the “AIMS family” since the institute was founded as a fledgling initiative in 2003!
Our 90 taught Master’s students are roughly divided into two focus areas; Mathematical Sciences (50 students) and Artificial Intelligence for Science (40 students). Each focus area is managed by a different academic director, and the two academic directors work together as a team to ensure a holistic and high level of training of students at AIMS.
AIMS South Africa is seeking an Academic Director (Mathematical Sciences) for its academic leadership team. We are looking for someone:● who has a PhD in the mathematical sciences,● who has teaching experience at graduate and postgraduate level,● who thinks actively about advancing graduate mathematical education in Africa,● who flourishes doing research,● who can lead and mentor a diverse team of academic professionals● who enjoys working closely with students, tutors and visiting lecturers on a daily basis,● who can build innovative academic training programs.University experience at the level of Associate Professor would be an asset to the role.
